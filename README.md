This repository contains the code developeb for my master thesis.

The ERA5 Extreme Climate Index (E3CI) is a measure used to identify and quantify extreme weather events such as heat waves, cold snaps, droughts and intense precipitation. This index is crucial for better understanding climate variability and its impact on various sectors, including agriculture, public health and natural resource management. The ability to accurately predict the E3CI is critical to mitigating the adverse effects of these extreme events, allowing decision-makers to implement effective prevention and response strategies.


It is from the code presented in this repository that the results of the last chapter of the Master's thesis have been extracted.
